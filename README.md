## Description

Command Line Application that leverages both backend (Node.js) and frontend (Javascript and HTML) languages.  Application produces a HTML based team of employees setup by end user.  End user answers prompt questions based on predetermined roles.  On the backed, Object Oriented Programming is used by developing a series of Classes/ Constructors which allows the application dynamic reusability. The app is run using Node.js, and uses the "Inquirer" and "FS" node modules. 

This app uses concepts from Test-Driven Development. Jest is used to perform tests on all the class constructors to ensure that they behave as expected.
